# Plundervolt 

**NOTE:** This repo is currently a bit preliminary, we will add more examples and update the existing ones over the coming days/weeks. 

Current (known) problems include:

 * Lack of documentation overall
 * The SGX code (AES) partially depends on sgx-step (https://github.com/jovanbulck/sgx-step) - we'll clean this up and add documentation
 * The "data flow" sample code is still missing
